# Remarketing

Track visitors and customers with Facebook Pixel, Google Ads, and custom scripts for retargeting campaigns.

## Overview

Remarketing tags fire on key ecommerce events:

- **PageView** — Store visits
- **ViewContent** — Product detail views
- **AddToCart** — Items added to cart
- **InitiateCheckout** — Checkout page loaded
- **Purchase** — Order completed and paid (thank-you page)

Currency is taken from your store's base currency (Setup → Settings → Currencies). Events include value, currency, and item details for GA4 and Facebook compatibility.

## Custom Script

For other platforms (e.g., TikTok, Pinterest, custom analytics):

1. Enable **Custom remarketing script**.
2. Paste your full tracking code (including `<script>` tags) in the text area.
3. The script is injected on product and checkout pages.

## Thank-You Page

After a successful order, customers are briefly redirected to a **thank-you page** that fires the Purchase event with order total, then redirects to the invoice. This ensures the pixel fires even when payment happens on an external page.
