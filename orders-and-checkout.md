```

## Staff Orders

Staff can create orders on behalf of customers without using the storefront:

1. Go to **Products → Add New Order** (or **Staff Order**).
2. Select the **client**.
3. Add products (with quantities).
4. Apply coupon if needed.
5. Create the order. An invoice is generated.

## Order History

1. Go to **Products → Order History**.
2. View all orders with:
   - Order ID
   - Client
   - Invoice link
   - Status
   - Date

---

## Order Status & Invoices

- Orders are tied to Perfex **invoices**.
- When an invoice is marked **Paid**, the module:
  - Reduces product quantity
  - Sends order confirmation emails
  - Triggers gift card creation (for gift card purchases)
  - Records referral commissions (if applicable)

---

## Cart Behavior

- Cart data is stored in the **session**.
- Logged-in customers: cart can be associated with the client.
- **Abandoned cart** tracking (if enabled) records carts that are not completed.

---

## Coupon & Gift Card at Checkout

- **Coupon** — Enter code and click Apply. Discount is shown.
- **Gift card** — Enter gift card code and click Apply. Balance is applied to the total.

Both can be used together in a single order where rules allow.
