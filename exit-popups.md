4. Impressions and clicks are tracked.

## Testing Exit Popups

Exit popups run only on the customer shop frontend (`/products/client` and related pages). To test immediately:

1. Open your store URL with `?products_exit_popup_test=1` appended, e.g.:  
   `https://yoursite.com/products/client?products_exit_popup_test=1`
2. In test mode, the first available popup will appear after ~500 ms (or use **Time Delay** with a few seconds for reliable testing).
3. Alternatively, create a popup with trigger **Time Delay** (e.g., 3 sec) or **Scroll Depth** (e.g., 50%) for easier manual testing.

## Tracking

- **Impressions** — When the popup is shown.
- **Clicks** — When the CTA is clicked.

Data is stored for reporting and optimization.
